This is a Bloons Tower Defense 6 mod that randomly changes your in game speed. Based off from Timotheeee1's speedhackmelon which you can find [here](https://github.com/Timotheeee/btd6_mods/tree/master/speedhackmelon)

Pretty much all of the variables that it uses are configurable through mod settings so take a look at that if you want to mess with for example the minimum or maximum speed
it could give you
